In this project I created a simple rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript. This is the first part of the project (in the second part I will add make a web page where a user can play it). The game consists of 5 rounds and each time the user chooses rock, paper or scissors. The computer randomly chooses one of these items and then the winner receives one point. If both user and computer chose the same item, they both receive 1 point. At the end of the game, the winner is announced and the final score is shown.
